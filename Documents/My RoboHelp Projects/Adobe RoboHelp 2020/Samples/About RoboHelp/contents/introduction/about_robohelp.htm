  <h1>About <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span></h1>
  <p class="emphasis1" style="margin-bottom: 6pt">The purpose of the About RoboHelp sample project is to highlight the features, explain how to use them in an easy to follow way and let you see some of them in use.<br />
    It is less detailed than Adobe&#39;s own online help but the aim is to get you going quickly. For many users that will be sufficient to get started, leaving the online help for the more detailed issues.<br />
    Use the project to test things without risking damage to your production projects.</p>
  <p><span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> 2019 shipped with a Classic version but also introduced a new version with a completely new UI whose features are described in this project. During the life of <span data-keyref="ProdName_2019">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> many updates added to the features and functionality.</p>
  <p>These were further improved in <span data-keyref="ProdName_2020">Adobe RoboHelp 2020</span> which is licensed on a subscription only model. The subscription covers all updates and new versions.</p>
  <p class="emphasis2">This sample project will be updated from time to time but may not always be in sync with the latest product update. It is currently synced with Version <span data-keyref="Current Version">2020.5</span>.</p>
  <h2>What&#39;s In <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span>?</h2>
  <p>The new and changed features in <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> are highlighted in <a href="2020.htm">What&#39;s in Adobe RoboHelp</a> and explained in the topics in this project.</p>
  <p>Users upgrading from a Classic version, you should also see <a href="2019.htm">What&#39;s in Adobe RoboHelp 2019?</a></p>
  <h2>Upgrading New UI Versions</h2>
  <p>Upgrading refers to new versions and should not be confused with in-version updates. If you are upgrading to a higher version, before you start work note the Import Settings option on the Starter Screen. It allows you to import your settings into your new version.</p>

  <h2>Making Changes to the Sample Project</h2>
  <p>Should you make changes to the sample project that you cannot reverse, you can easily get a fresh copy. Delete the broken copy that is in Documents &gt; My RoboHelp Projects and grab a fresh copy from Program Files. Don&#39;t attempt to open it from there, it will not function properly.</p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 12pt">C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe RoboHelp 2020\resources\data\template\projects\About RoboHelp.</p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNote.png" /> With each update, both copies of the sample project are updated.<br />
    The copy in Program Files is replaced entirely.<br />
    In the copy in My RoboHelp Projects the files that are installed are also replaced but any files you have added will be left. If you want to retain your current copy with its installed files, rename the folder in My RoboHelp Project before you apply the update or move it to another location.</p>
