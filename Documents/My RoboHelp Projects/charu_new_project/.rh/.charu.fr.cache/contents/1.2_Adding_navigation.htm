  A user manual should give assistance to people by providing information about how to use a product. Finding the right information that solves the user’s problem should take as little time as possible.
  The crafting of meaningful headings is one of the tools that aid users in finding information. However, there are several other tools to help the user finding the information he/she wants, such as:
  
    Table of contents
    Page numbering
    Index
  
   
   
   
   
   
   
  通过求解方程组确定速度势中待定系数，计算挡板-堆石防波提的反射系数、透射系数和能量耗散系数；
  采用理论解析，结合多项Galerkin近似法对垂直挡板处两侧的压力损失模拟建立边值问题。
   
   
  Determine the undetermined coefficient in the velocity potential by solving the equation system, and calculate the reflection coefficient, transmission coefficient and energy dissipation coefficient of the baffle-rockfill anti-wave
