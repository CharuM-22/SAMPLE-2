  2.1 Creation of image
   
  Once the user manual has been reviewed and optimized, the texts are more or less definite. This means that any images can now be created and added to the content.
  The reason to wait until the texts are ready is that creating or editing images can be time-consuming. As images should support, replace, or augment text, you want to wait to create them until the texts are final.
  Images in user manuals may include illustrations, photos, screenshots, tables, diagrams and schematics.
  There are many great tools that can help you create your images, such as:
  
    Snagit or Adobe Photoshop for editing screenshots or photos
    Solidworks Composer or Google Sketchup for creating line drawings
    Lucidchart or Microsoft Visio for diagrams and schematics
