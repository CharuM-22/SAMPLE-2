    Look for a translator with similar experience. This could be a translator who is experienced in translating technical content, with similar products or with translating user manuals.
    If you need to translate to several languages, working with a translation agency might save you lots of time.
    Ask the tanslator or agency about their quality procedures and who is going to revise the text after translation..

    As you know your product best and who your audience is, it might be a good idea to provide the translator or agency a glossary or a list with the terminology that you want to use.
    Look for a translator who can work directly in your Word or InDesign file or find an agency that can do the DTP works as well. Alternatively, you can do this yourself, of course.
