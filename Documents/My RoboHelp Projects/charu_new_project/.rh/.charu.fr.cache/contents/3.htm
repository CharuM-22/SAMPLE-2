  3. USES OF USER MANUAL TEMPLATE
   
  The main tool that I developed in order to help Philip draw up his user manual is a User Manual Template. The template contains all the information and more from the list above. It complies with the requirements for his product.
  The User Manual Template can be used for creating your manual for your system, tool, device, instrument, or for creating an installation manual, software manual, operational manual, maintenance manual or training manual.
