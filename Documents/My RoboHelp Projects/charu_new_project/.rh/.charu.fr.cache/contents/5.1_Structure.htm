  5.1 Structure
  Applications are usually broken into logical chunks called "tiers", where every tier is assigned a role.[4] Traditional applications consist only of 1 tier, which resides on the client machine, but web applications lend themselves to an n-tiered approach by nature.[4] Though many variations are possible, the most common structure is the three-tiered application.[4] In its most common form, the three tiers are called presentation, application and storage, in this order. A web browser is the first tier (presentation), an engine using some dynamic Web content technology (such as ASP, CGI, ColdFusion, Dart, JSP/Java, Node.js, PHP, Python or Ruby on Rails) is the middle tier (application logic), and a database is the third tier (storage).[4] The web browser sends requests to the middle tier, which services them by making queries and updates against the database and generates a user interface.
