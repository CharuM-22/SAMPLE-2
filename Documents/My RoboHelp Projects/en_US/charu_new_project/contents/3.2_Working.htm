  <h1>3.2 Working</h1>
  <p>Web applications do not need to be downloaded since they are accessed through a network. Users can access a Web application through a web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari.</p>
  <p>For a web app to operate, it needs a Web server, application server, and a database. Web servers manage the requests that come from a client, while the application server completes the requested task. A database can be used to store any needed information.</p>
  <p>Web applications typically have short development cycles and can be made with small development teams. Most Web apps are written in<span> </span><a href="">JavaScript</a>,<span> </span><a href="">HTML5</a>, or Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Client-side programming typically utilizes these languages, which help build an applications<span> </span><a href="">front-end</a>. Server-side programming is done to create the<span> </span><a href="">scripts</a><span> </span>a Web app will use. Languages such as<span> </span><a href="">Python</a>, Java, and<span> </span><a href="">Ruby</a><span> </span>are commonly used in server-side programming</p>
