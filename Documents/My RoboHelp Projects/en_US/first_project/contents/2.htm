  <p> </p>
  <p>Machine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field&#39;s inception,is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.<sup id="cite_ref-81"><a href="">[</a></sup></p>

Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in—the program sees a number of examples of things from several categories and will learn to classify new inputs. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as &quot;function approximators&quot; trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;not spam&quot;.<span> </span>In<span> </span><a href="" title="Reinforcement learning">reinforcement learning</a><span> </span>the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent classifies its responses to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.<a href="" title="Transfer learning">Transfer learning</a><span> </span>is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem</p>
