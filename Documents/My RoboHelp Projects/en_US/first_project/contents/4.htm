  <h1>4. Foreign policy</h1>
  <p>Multiple nations around the globe employ artificial intelligence to assist with their foreign policy decisions. The Chinese Department of External Security Affairs – under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs – uses AI to review almost all its foreign investment projects for risk mitigation.The government of China plans to utilize artificial intelligence in its $900 billion global infrastructure development plan, called the &quot;Belt and Road Initiative&quot; for political, economic, and environmental risk alleviation.</p>
  <p>Over 200 applications of artificial intelligence are being used by over 46 United Nations agencies, in sectors ranging from health care dealing with issues such as combating COVID-19 to smart agriculture, to assist the UN in political and diplomatic relations.<span> </span>One example is the use of AI by the UN Global Pulse program to model the effect of the spread of COVID-19 on internally displaced people (IDP) and refugee settlements to assist them in creating an appropriate global health policy.</p>
