  <h1>5. Uses of AI</h1>
  <h3>Online shopping and advertising</h3>
  <p><span>Artificial intelligence is widely used to provide personalised recommendations to people, based for example on their previous searches and purchases or other online behaviour. AI is hugely important in commerce: optimising products, planning inventory, logistics etc.</span></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><span style="font-family:&#39;Arial Black&#39;;"><a id="Web_search"></a>Web search</span></p>
  <p>Search engines learn from the vast input of data, provided by their users to provide relevant search results.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Digital personal assistants (DPA):</h3>
  <h3 style="font-weight: normal">Smartphones use AI to provide services that are as relevant and personalised as possible. Virtual assistants answering questions, providing recommendations and helping organise daily routines have become ubiquitous.</h3>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Machine translations</h3>
  <p>Language translation software, either based on written or spoken text, relies on artificial intelligence to provide and improve translations. This also applies to functions such as automated subtitling.</p>
