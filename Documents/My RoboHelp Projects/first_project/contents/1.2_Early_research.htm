  <p>The field of AI research was born at<span> </span><a href="" title="Dartmouth workshop">a workshopDrop-down Title</a><span> </span>at<span> </span><a href="" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a><span> </span>in 1956.The attendees became the founders and leaders of AI research.They and their students produced programs that the press described as &quot;astonishing&quot;:<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="">[h]</a></sup><span> </span>computers were learning<span> </span><a href="" title="Draughts">checkers</a><span> </span>strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving<span> </span><a href="" title="Theorem">logical theorems</a><span> </span>and speaking English.By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the<span> </span><a href="" title="DARPA">Department of Defense</a><sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="">[28]</a></sup><span> </span>and laboratories had been established around the world.</p>
  <p>Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with<span> </span><a href="" title="Artificial general intelligence">artificial general intelligence</a><span> </span>and considered this the goal of their field.<span> </span><a href="" title="Herbert A. Simon">Herbert Simon</a><span> </span>predicted, &quot;machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do&quot;.<sup id="cite_ref-40"></sup><span> </span><a href="" title="Marvin Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a><span> </span>agreed, writing, &quot;within a generation ... the problem of creating &#39;artificial intelligence&#39; will substantially be solved&quot;</p>
  <p>They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the<span> </span><a href="" title="Lighthill report">criticism</a><span> </span>of<span> </span><a href="" title="Sir James Lighthill">Sir James Lighthill</a><span> </span>and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to<span> </span><a href="" title="Mansfield Amendment">fund more productive projects</a>, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an &quot;<a href="" title="AI winter">AI winter</a>&quot;, a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult</p>
