  <p><span>The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has subtly grown to become part of everyday life. It is used every day in<span> </span></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system" title="Facial recognition system">facial recognition</a><span><span> </span>software. It is the first measure of security for many companies in the form of a biometric authentication. This means of authentication allows even the most official organizations such as the United States Internal Revenue Service to verify a person&#39;s identity<span> </span></span><sup id="cite_ref-auto3_288-0"><a href="">[264]</a></sup><span><span> </span>via a database generated from machine learning. As of the year 2022, the United States IRS requires those who do not undergo a live interview with an agent to complete a biometric verification of their identity via ID.me&#39;s facial recognition tool.</span></p>

  <h3>School:</h3>
  <p><span>The artificial intelligence software is used in the instruction of English language via the company Riiid.</span><span><span> </span>Riiid is a Korean education company working alongside Japan to give students the means to learn and use their English communication skills via engaging with artificial intelligence in a live chat.</span><span>Riid is not the only company to do this. An American company such as<span> </span></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo" title="Duolingo">Duolingo</a><span><span> </span>is very well known for their automated teaching of 41 languages.<span> </span></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babbel" title="Babbel">Babbel</a><span>, a German language learning program also uses artificial intelligence in its teaching automation, allowing for European students to learn vital communication skills needed in social, economic, and diplomatic settings.  Artificial intelligence will also automate the routine tasks that teachers need to do such as grading, taking attendance, and handling routine student inquiries.</span><span>This enables the teacher to carry on with the complexities of teaching that an automated machine cannot handle. These include creating exams, explaining complex material in a way that will benefit students individually and handling unique questions from students.</span></p>

  <h4>Medicine:</h4>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Unlike the human brain, which possess generalized intelligence, the specialized intelligence of AI can serve as a means of support to physicians internationally. The medical field has a diverse and profound amount of data in which AI can employ to generate a predictive diagnosis. Researchers at an Oxford hospital have developed artificial intelligence that can diagnose heart scans for heart disease and cancer.<span style="font-size: 11.6667px;"> </span>This artificial intelligence can pick up diminutive details in the scans that doctors may miss. As such, artificial intelligence in medicine will better the industry, giving doctors the means to precisely diagnose their patients using the tools available. The artificial intelligence algorithms will also be used to further improve diagnosis over time, via an application of machine learning called precision medicine.<sup id="cite_ref-292"><a href="">[268]</a></sup><span> </span>Furthermore, the narrow application of artificial intelligence can use &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning" title="Deep learning">deep learning</a>&quot; in order to improve medical image analysis. In radiology imaging, AI uses deep learning algorithms to identify potentially cancerous lesions which is an important process assisting in early diagnosis.</p>
